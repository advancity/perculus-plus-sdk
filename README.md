Perculus+ Software Development Kit
==================================
<a href="http://www.perculus.com" target="_blank">Perculus</a> is a virtual classroom system developed by <a href="http://www.advancity.com.tr" target="_blank">Advancity</a>.

Perculus+ is the last version of Perculus virtual classroom platform which is developed by HTML5 and WebRTC technologies.

Perculus SDK+ is a class library that is built on top of Perculus+ REST API.

There are two versions of the SDK and both are developed by C#:

1. Perculus.XSDK: This targets .Net Core 2.1.
2. Perculus.XSDK.Framework: This targets .Net Framework 4.6.

For each version, there is an example application.

The application codes of each version are almost same. There are slight differences. In the future, we aim to decrease the amount of duplicate code.
